# Smooth dynamics: fragmented GNATprove results

Each row is one bounded subprogram, line or whole-unit invocation on unchanged sources.
A completed row is limited to the emitted obligations and their contracts;
it is not a proof of physical correctness or of the complete simulator.
An unproved check is not, by itself, a demonstrated runtime failure.
Timeouts and jobs not yet run must not be counted as passes.
